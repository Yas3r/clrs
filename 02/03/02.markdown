Here is a simple modification:

    MERGE(A, p, q, r)
      n1 = q - p + 1
      n2 = r - q
      let L[1..n₁] and R[1..n₂] be new arrays
      for i = 1 to n₁
          L[i] = A[p + i - 1]
      for j = 1 to n₂
          R[j] = A[q + j]
      i = 1
      j = 1
      for k = p to r
          if i > n₁
              A[k] = R[j]
              j = j + 1
          else if j > n₂
              A[k] = L[i]
              i = i + 1
          else if L[i] ≤ R[j]
              A[k] = L[i]
              i = i + 1
          else
              A[k] = R[j]
              j = j + 1

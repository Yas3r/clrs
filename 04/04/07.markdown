Let's ignore the floor. Previous exercises illustrate how this can be handled.

The depth of the tree is $\lg{n}$, each level is $2^icn$ and there are
$4^\{\lg{n}} = n^2$ leaves.

Thus:

$$ T(n) = \sum_{i=0}^{\lg{n}- 1}2^icn + \Theta(n^2)
        = cn \sum_{i=0}^{\lg{n}-1}2^i + \Theta(n^2)
        = cn \frac{2^{\lg{n}} - 1}{2 - 1} + \Theta(n^2)
        = \Theta(n^2) $$

Let's guess $T(n) \le cn^2 + 2cn$:

$$ T(n) \le 4c(n/2)^2 + 2cn/2 + cn
        \le cn^2 + 2cn $$

Let's guess $T(n) \ge cn^2 + 2cn$:

$$ T(n) \ge 4c(n/2)^2 + 2cn/2 + cn
        \ge cn^2 + 2cn $$

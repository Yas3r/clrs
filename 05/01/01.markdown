A total order is a partial order that is a total relation ($\forall a,b \in A:
a R b \text{ or } b R a$). A relation is a partial order if it is reflexive,
antisymmetric and transitive.

Let's assume that the relation is "is as good or better".

* _Reflexive_: This is a bit trivial, but everybody is as good or better as
  themselves.
* _Transitive_: If A is better than B and B is better than C, then A is better
  than C - that's also obvious.
* _Antisymmetric_: If A is better than B, then B is not better than A.

So far we have a partial order.

Since we assume we can compare any two candidates, then comparison must be a
total relation and thus we have a total order.

Simple!

1. Generate two random numbers $x$ and $y$
2. If they are not the same, return $x$
3. Otherwise, repeat from step 1

The change of getting [0, 1] is the same as getting [1, 0].

The likelyhood of that happening is $2pq$. Thus, the expected number of trials
is $1/(2pq)$ making the running time $\O\Big(\frac{1}{p(1-p)}\Big)$.

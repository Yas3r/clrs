You hire twice when you first hire is the candidate with rank $i$ and all the
candidates with rank $k > i$ come after the candidate with rank $n$. There
are $n - i$ better suited candidates and the probability of the best one
coming first is $1/(n-i)$ (we can ignore the other candidates and they don't
affect the probability). Thus, the probability for hiring twice if your first
candidate has rank $i$ is:

$$ \Pr\\{T_i\\} = \frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{n-i} $$

The first part reflects the probability of picking that particular candidate
out of $n$.

The probability to hire twice is:

$$ \Pr\\{T\\} = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\Pr\\{T_i\\}
              = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\frac{1}{n}\frac{1}{n-i}
              = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\frac{1}{i}
              = \frac{1}{n} \Big(\lg(n-1) + \O(1)\Big) $$

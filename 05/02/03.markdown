Expectation of a single die $X_i$, is unsurprisingly:

$$ \E[X_k] = \sum_{i=0}^6 i \Pr\\{X_k = i\\}
           = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6}
           = \frac{21}{6}
           = 3.5 $$

As for multiple dice:

$$ \E[X] = \E\Big[\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\Big]
         = \sum_{i=1}^n \E[X_i]
         = \sum_{i=1}^n 3.5
         = 3.5 \cdot n $$

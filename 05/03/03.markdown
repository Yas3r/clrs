It does not. Intuitivelly, this one can go in $n^n$ different ways while there
are $n!$ combinations. Since $n!$ does not divide $n^n$, there is no way that
this can be a uniform distribution. (Why doesn't it divide $n^n$? That's the
intuitive part. $n!$ is divisable by $n-1$, but $n^n$ can't be for $n > 2$).

Of course, this is a popular problem and there are tons of posts and papers
written on it. Here's [one from Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/12/the-danger-of-naivete.html)

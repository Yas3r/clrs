Each combination should have a $1/\binom{n}{m}$ chance of showing up. Let's
establish an invariant for `RANDOM-SAMPLE(m,n)`. We are going to go with:

> `RANDOM-SAMPLE(m,n)` returns a uniformly distributed combination.

We shall do induction on $m$. It's trivially so when $m$ is 1 (or 0). Let's
assume the invariant holds for $m-1$. Let's see what happens when we pass $m$.

The recursive call returns an $m-1$ sample with uniform probability. There are
two options - either the new $m$-subset includes $n$ or not.

If that happens (probability: $m/n$), the probability for each combination
including $n$ is:

$$ \frac{m}{n}\bigg(1/\binom{n-1}{m-1}\bigg) = 1/\binom{n}{m} $$

If it does not (probability: $(n-m)/n$), it includes one of the $(n-m)$ numbers
not present. The chance for each is:

$$ \frac{n-m}{n}\bigg(1/\binom{n-1}{m}\bigg) = 1/\binom{n}{m} $$

This is the pseudocode is as follows:

    HEAP-DELETE(A, i):
      A[i] = A[A.heap-size]
      A.heap-size -= 1
      MAX-HEAPIFY(A, i)

We just move the last element of the heap to the deleated position and then
call `MAX-HEAPIFY` on it. This works, because the element is already smaller
than its parent (because it was already under it on the heap), but might be
larger than its children. `MAX-HEAPIFY` restored the heap property.

### Demonstration

At the end of the loop, the variables have the following values:

    x = 13
    j = 9
    i = 10

### Correctness

The indices will not walk of the array. At the first check $i < j$, $i = p$ and
$j \ge p$ (because $A[p] = x$). If $i = j$, the algorithm will terminate
without accessing "invalid" elements. If $i < j$, the next loop will also have
indices $i$ and $j$ within the array, (because $i \le r$ and $j \ge p$). Note
that if one of the indices gets to the end of the array, then $i$ won't be less
or equal to $j$ any more.

As for the return value, it will be at least one less than $j$. At the first
iteration, either (1) $A[p]$ is the maximum element and then $i = p$ and $j = p
< r$ or (2) it is not and $A[p]$ gets swapped with $A[j]$ where $j \le r$. The
loop will not terminate and on the next iteration, $j$ gets decremented (before
eventually getting returned). Combining those two cases we get $p \le j < r$.

Finally, it's easy to observe the following invariant:

> Before the condition comparing $i$ to $j$, all elements $A[p..i-1] \le x$ and
> all elements $A[j+1..r] \ge x$.

**Initialization**. The two **repeat** blocks establish just this condition.

**Maintenance**. By exchanging $A[i]$ and $A[j]$ we make the $A[p..i] \le x$
and $A[j..r] \ge x$. Incrementing $i$ and decrementing $j$ maintain this
invariant.

**Termination**. The loop terminates when $i \ge j$. The invariant still holds
at termination.

The third bit follows directly from this invariant.

### Implementation

There's some C code below.

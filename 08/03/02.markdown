**Stable**: Insertion sort, merge sort

**Not stable**: Heapsort, quicksort

We can make any algorithm stable by mapping the array to an array of pairs,
where the first element in each pair is the original element and the second is
its index. Then we sort lexicographically. This scheme takes additional
$\Theta(n)$ space.

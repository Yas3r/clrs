We can compare the elements in a tournament fashion - we split them into
pairs, compare each pair and then proceed to compare the winners in the same
fashion. We need to keep track of each "match" the potential winners have
participated in.

We select a winner in $n - 1$ matches. At this point, we know that the second
smallest element is one of the $\lg{n}$ elements that lost to the smallest Â­
each of them is smaller than the ones it has been compared to, prior to
losing. In another $\lceil \lg{n} \rceil - 1$ comparisons we can find the
smallest element out of those. This is the answer we are looking for.

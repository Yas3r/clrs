The are two cases where it appears that `RANDOMIZED-SELECT` can make a call to
a 0-length array:

1. Line 8 with $k = 1$. But for this to happen, $i$ needs to be 0. And that
   cannot happen since the initial call is supposed to pass a nonzero $i$ and
   the recursive calls either pass $i$ unmodified or pass $i - k$ where $i >
   k$.
2. Line 9 with $q = r$. But for this to happen, $i$ must be greater than $k$,
   that is $i > q - p + 1 = r - p + 1$, that is, $i$ needs to be greater than
   the number of elements in the array. Initially that is not true and both
   recursive calls maintain an invariant that $i$ is less or equal to the
   number of elements in $A[p..q]$.

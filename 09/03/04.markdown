A strict proof might require a more advanced proof apparatus than I command
(like graphs and adversary algorithms, for example?), so I will just sketch it
briefly.

In order to determine the $i$th order statistic, any algorithm needs to
establish in some way that there are $i - 1$ elements smaller than the result
and $n - i$ elements larger than the result. We can visualize the algorithm as
a directed graph, where all the elements are edges. Each comparison introduces
a node from the smaller to the larger element. To produce a result, there must
be $i - 1$ elements that (transitively) point to the $i$th order statistic and
$n - i$ elements that the $i$th order statistic (transitively) points to.
There cannot be more (property of the order statistics) and if there are less,
then there are elements whose position in regard to the $i$th order statistic
is undetermined.

In order to find the result, the algorithm needs to build the knowledge
presented in such a graph and it can use it to return the sets of smaller and
larger elements.

As an example, both algorithms presented in the chapter leave the array
partitioned around the $i$th order statistic.

Assuming that fetching an element should return the satellite data of all the
stored elements, we can have each key map to a doubly linked list.

* `INSERT` appends the element to the list in constant time
* `DELETE` removes the element from the linked list in constant time (the
  element contains pointers to the previous and next element)
* `SEARCH` returns the first element, which is a node in a linked list, in
  constant time

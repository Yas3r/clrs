There are $2^n$ possible inputs. We can represent the possible binary functions
completely as binary numbers of $2^n$ digits. There $2^{2^n}$ of those.

If there are $2^m$ possible outputs, we can represent the functions as numbers
of $2^n$ digits in base $2^m$. This makes the answer of the second question:

$$ (2^m)^{2^n} $$

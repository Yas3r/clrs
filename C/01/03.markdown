If we pick a chair as the first one and a direction, in which the chairs are
increasing, there are $n!$ ways to seat the professors. However, an arrangement
$\\{1, 2, \ldots, n\\}$ is identical to $\\{2, 3, \ldots, n, 1\\}$ and there
are $n$ of those identical arrangements (one starting on each professor). Since
identical arrangements are in groups of size $n$, the total number of seatings
is $n!/n = (n-1)!$.

There are 49 even numbers and 50 odd in that set. To get an even number, we
either need two odd and one even or three even.

$$ \langle \text{2 odd, 1 even} \rangle = 49\frac{50!}{2! \cdot 48!} = \frac{50 \cdot 49^2}{2} \\\\
   \langle \text{3 even} \rangle = \frac{49!}{3! \cdot 46!} = \frac{49 \cdot 48 \cdot 47}{6} \\\\
   \langle \text{even sum} \rangle = \frac{49 \cdot 48 \cdot 47}{6} + \frac{50 \cdot 49^2}{2}
     = 78449
$$

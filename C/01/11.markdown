First, let's establish that, $j!k! \le (j+k)!$. Both sides have the same number
of terms, but the right side has $k$ terms more - $(j+1)(j+2)\ldots(j+k)$ -
that are greater than the corresponding terms on the left side
$1\cdot2\cdot\ldots k$.

Thus:

$$ \binom{n}{j} \binom{n-j}{k}
   = \frac{n!}{j!(n-j)!} \frac{(n-j)!}{k!(n-j-k)!}
   = \frac{n!}{j!k!(n-j-k)!}
   \ge \frac{n!}{(j+k)!(n-j-k)!}
   = \binom{n}{j+k}
$$

As for the argument, the right side is the number of ways in which we can:

1. Choose $j$ elements out of $n$
2. Choose $k$ elements out of the remaining $n-j$ elements

There are more ways to do that than just choosing $j+k$ elements out of $n$,
because this implies some ordering in the choice. For example, if $j = k = 1$,
there are two ways to pick two elements (each one first) with this approach,
but only one otherwise.

If $n = 4, j = k = 1$, then equality does not hold.

This is actually tricky. Fortunatelly, [this answer][answer] helper me.

[answer]: http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/63207/produce-output-with-certain-probability-using-fair-coin-flips

You represent $a/b$ as binary. Then you start flipping coins and expect each
flip to match a digit (0 for heads, 1 for tails). If you expect a 0, but get 1,
you return tail. If you expect 1 and get a 0, you return heads. Otherwise, you
keep doing it.

To put it otherwise, just the flips produce a random number in binary. If you
expect 0, but get 1, then you have produced a number greated than $a/b$.
Otherwise, you have produced a number less than it.

The probability of terminating is $1/2$ at each flip. The expected number of
throws is:

$$ \sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{r}{2^r}
   = \frac{1/2}{1/4}
   = 2 $$

Don't know when this came from? Well, for $k < 1$:

$$ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}kx^k = \frac{x}{(1 - x)^2} $$

How do you get that, you ask? You just integrate this sum:

$$ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}x^k = \frac{1}{1-x} $$

Mindblowing.

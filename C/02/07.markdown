Get a dice with $n^2$ sides (you can actually construct one of those). Assign
the numbers $1 \ldots n$ to $n$ colors, non of which is black. Use each color
to paint $n-1$ sides, paint one side striped with all colors, and paint the
rest black. Here's a table:

|         |  1  |  2  |  3  | ... | n |
|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-:|
|  **1**  |  1  |  2  |  3  | ... | n |
|  **2**  |  1  |  2  |  3  | ... | n |
|  **3**  |  1  |  2  |  3  | ... | n |
|   ...   | ... | ... | ... | ... | n |
| **n-1** |  1  |  2  |  3  | ... | n |
|  **n**  | all |  -  |  -  | ... | - |

Counting the side painted with all colors, there are $(n-1 + 1)/n^2 = 1/n$ ways
to get each color. For any two colors, there are $1/n^2$ ways, which satisfies
the equation for independence. However, for $k$ colors, the chances are too
$1/n^2$, where they should be $1/n^k$ if that event was independent.

Thus, each pair is independent, but each subset with three or more elements is
not.

I'm actually quite proud of this solution.

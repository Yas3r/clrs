Two people use the same coin.

* **A** - person 1 tosses heads
* **B** - person 2 tosses heads
* **C** - the coin is biased (falls heads only) - happens one in three times

Thus:

$$
\Pr\\{A\\} = \frac 1 3 \cdot 1 + \frac 2 3 \cdot \frac 1 2 = \frac 2 3 \\\\
\Pr\\{B\\} = \frac 1 3 \cdot 1 + \frac 2 3 \cdot \frac 1 2 = \frac 2 3 \\\\
\Pr\\{A \cap B\\} = \frac 1 3 \cdot 1 + \frac 2 3 \cdot \frac 1 4 = \frac 1 2
$$

The two events are not independent, because:

$$ \frac 2 3 = \Pr\\{A \cap B\\} \neq \Pr\\{A\\} \cdot \Pr\\{B\\} = \frac 4 9 $$

However, they are conditionally independent, because:

$$ 1 = \Pr\\{A \cap B | C \\} = \Pr\\{A | C\\} \cdot \Pr\\{B | C\\} = 1 $$

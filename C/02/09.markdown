This is [very popular](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).

If you are always given this choice and take it:

* If you picked the right curtain (probability $1/3$), you will switch to an
  empty stage
* If you picked a wrong curtain (probability $2/3$), you will switch to the
  prize (that's the only option, since the other empty stage is shown)

Effectively, you interchange success and failure. That way, the probability to
win is $2/3$ and you should always take it (if the choice is given to you in an
unbiased fashion).

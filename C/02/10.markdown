Obviously the event took place before prisoner X obtained that knowledge and
this should not impact his chances in anyway.

But words are cheap, let's use math:

* **y** is the event of the guard saying prisoner Y will be executed
* **X**, **Y** and **Z** are the events of each prisoner going free
* If X is going free, the guard has a 50% of saying Y is executed

$$
\Pr\\{y|X\\} = \frac 1 2 \\\\
\Pr\\{y\\} = \Pr\\{y \cap X\\} + \Pr\\{y \cap Y\\} + \Pr\\{y \cap Z\\} = \frac 1 3 \cdot \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 3 \cdot 0 + \frac 1 3 \cdot 1 = \frac 1 6 + \frac 1 3 = \frac 1 2 \\\\
\Pr\\{X|y\\} = \frac{\Pr\\{y|X\\} \cdot \Pr\\{X\\}}{\Pr\\{y\\}} = \frac{\frac 1 2 \cdot \frac 1 3}{\frac 1 2} = \frac 1 3
$$

The expectation of the max element having an index $i$ is $\Pr\\{X = i\\} = \frac 1 n$.

$$ \E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n i \cdot \Pr\\{X = i\\}
         = \sum_{i=1}^n i \cdot \frac 1 n
         = \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n i
         = \frac 1 n \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
         = \frac{n+1}{2} $$

Not a surprising result.

Curious: the same logic applies for the minimum element. Thus, the expectation
for the index of the minimum element is the same.

There is a hidden assumption that $X$ and $Y$ are on the same domain
(otherwise, you can't define $\max(X, Y)$). The expectations can be expanded as
this:

$$ \E[\max(X, Y)] = \sum n \cdot \max(\Pr\\{X = n\\}, \Pr\\{Y = n\\}) \\\\
   \E[X] = \sum n \Pr\\{X = n\\} \qquad
   \E[X] = \sum n \Pr\\{Y = n\\} $$

Each of the summands in the first formula appears in either $\E[X]$ or $\E[Y]$.
Their sum contains twice as many, all nonnegative. That makes it equal or
greater.

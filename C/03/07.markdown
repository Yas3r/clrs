Both of them, expanded, are:

$$ \Pr\\{X \ge t\\} = \sum_{s \in S:X(s) \ge t}\Pr\\{s\\} \\\\
   \Pr\\{X' \ge t\\} = \sum_{s \in S:X'(s) \ge t}\Pr\\{s\\} $$

Each term of the second sum is present in the first sum, because $X(s) \ge
X'(s)$. This makes them at least equal. There might be additional terms in the
first sum (when $X(s) \ge t > X'(s)$. Thus it can also be greater.

The probability of no successes of $n$ trials is:

$$ b(0;n,p) = \binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k}
            = \binom{n}{0} q^n
            = (1-p)^n
            = \Big(1 - \frac{1}{n}\Big)^n
            = \frac{1}{\Big(1-\frac{1}{n}\Big)^{-n}}
$$

The probability of one success of $n$ trials is:


$$ b(1;n,p) = \binom{n}{1} \frac{1}{n} \bigg(1 - \frac{1}{n}\bigg)^{n-1}
            = \frac{1}{\Big(1-\frac{1}{n}\Big)^{-(n-1)}}
$$

We know that:

$$ e = \lim_{n \to \infty}\bigg(1 + \frac{1}{n}\bigg)^n
     = \lim_{n \to \infty}\bigg(1 - \frac{1}{n}\bigg)^{-n} $$

We can just substitute in the examples above and get approximately $1/e$.

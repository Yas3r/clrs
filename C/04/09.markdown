Let $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots Y_n$ be indicator random variables for the events in $A$.

Let $Z_1, Z_2, \ldots Z_n$ be new random variables, such that:

* If $Y_i = 1$ then $Z_i = 1$
* If $Y_i = 0$ then $Z_i = 1$ with probability $\frac{p_i' - p_i}{1-p_i}$

Let's calculate $\Pr\\{Z_i\\}$:

$$ \Pr\\{Z_i\\} = p_i \Pr\\{Y_i = 1\\} + (1 - p_i) \cdot \frac{p_i' - p_i}{1-p_i}
                = p_i + p_i' - p_i
                = p_i' $$

Since we know that $p_i' \ge p_i$, we can do the following:

$$ \Pr\\{X' \ge k\\} = \Pr\\{Z_1 + Z_2 + \ldots + Z_n\\}
                   \ge \Pr\\{Y_1 + Y_2 + \ldots + Y_n\\}
                     = \Pr\\{X \ge k\\} $$

The last part can also be proven by exercise C.3-7.

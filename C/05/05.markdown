This is tricky. Let's introduce a new random variable $Y = n - X$.

$$ \nu = E[Y] = E[n - X] = n - E[x] = n - \mu $$

Using theorem C.8, we get:

$$ \Pr\\{Y - \nu > r\\} \le \bigg(\frac{\nu e}{r}\bigg)^r \\\\
   \Downarrow \\\\
   \Pr\\{\mu - X \ge r\\} \le \bigg(\frac{(n - \mu)e}{r}\bigg)^r
$$

It's similar with the other one, where $qn = (1-p)n = n - np$:

$$ \Pr\\{np - X\\}
   = \Pr\\{n - X - n + np\\}
   = \Pr\\{Y - qn > r\\}
   \le \bigg(\frac{nqe}{r}\bigg)^r $$

## Array indexing

Array indexing in C is 1-based, but in ItA it starts from 1. Translating pseudocode to C is hell.

## Style

I can't figure out the style I want to follow. Apart from the number of spaces, I'm not sure whether to go with descriptive names (like I would normally) or terse names (like the ones in the book). I err on the side of the later, since this is unusual for me.

I find it fascinating, that a lot of my C coding habits are still the ones I had in high school. I'm not particularly hygenic when it comes to writing it.

## Graphviz

I spend a lot of time playing with graphviz and it is a love-hate relationship. You can get a lot of thins draw, but unfortunatelly, you cannot get them drawn beautifully. It's very awkward at times and depends on weird conventions in the language (like catalog_ in the subgraphs). Finally, I managed to segfault it on multiple occasions.

## This needs care

When solving problem 2.1, I wrote a buggy version of the solution and it took me a while to figure out where the problem was. It ended up being wrong implementation of insertion sort. I need to write more tests and need to be way more careful when implementing those algorithms.

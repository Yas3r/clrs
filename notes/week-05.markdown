# Week 05 (2013-10-23 - 2013-10-30)

The chapter was simple enough. It was easy to solve and there were not many
surprises, apart from the analysis of the streaks expectation. I had a (few)
unsolved exercise(s), but apart from that everything made sense and was not
that hard.

I spent the whole week afterwards just entering the solutions. It was not that
easy, especially because it concided with OpenFest.
